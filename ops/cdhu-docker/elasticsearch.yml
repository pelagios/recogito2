# Heap size settings (adjust as needed)
# Remember that these settings depend on your system resources.
# It's recommended to set the heap size based on available RAM.
# For example, for a system with 16GB RAM, you might set it to 8GB.
# Be cautious not to allocate all available RAM to Elasticsearch.
# See Elasticsearch documentation for more guidance.

# -Xms specifies the initial heap size
