        This quick tutorial will give you an overview of Recogito's most important features.
        <strong>You will learn how to:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Upload texts and images</li>
        <li>Create annotations</li>
        <li>Identify and map places in your documents</li>
        <li>Export your data in order to re-use it outside of Recogito</li>
        <li>Invite other users to work with you</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="what">What is Recogito?</h2>

      <p>
        Recogito is an online platform for collaborative document annotation. It is
        maintained by <a href="http://commons.pelagios.org" target="_blank">Pelagios Commons</a>,
        a Digital Humanities initiative aiming to foster better linkages between online
        resources documenting the past.
      </p>

      <p>
        Recogito provides a personal workspace where you can upload, collect and organize
        your source materials - texts and images <!-- and tabular data-->- and collaborate in their
        annotation and interpretation. Recogito enables you to make your work more
        visible on the Web more easily, and to expose the results of your research
        as Open Data.
      </p>

      <p>
        This tutorial will teach you the essentials of working with Recogito. To complete it,
        you need a <a href="http://recogito.pelagios.org/signup" target="_blank">Recogito
        account</a>, and two sample documents: a plain .txt file with some text, and an image file.
      </p>

      <p class="tip">
        Tip: Open this tutorial in a separate browser window (or tab) so you can see it
        while you complete the steps.
      </p>

      <h2 id="upload">Step 1. Upload a Document</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>Documents</strong> are used to organize your materials in Recogito. Each document
        can consist of multiple files. But for now, we are just going to upload a document
        consisting of a single text file.
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="@routes.Assets.versioned("images/help/new-document.png")">
      </p>

      <p>
        Click <strong>New Document</strong>.
      </p>

      <h3>To upload a new text document</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Enter a title for your document and click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>
        <li>Upload your text file. You can either click <strong>Choose a File to Attach</strong>
          and select it in the file browser, or you can drag and drop it into the upload area with
          your mouse.</li>
        <li>Recogito can run <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition" target="_blank">Named
          Entity Recognition (NER)</a> on your text. This means it will attempt to identify and
          pre-annotate places and persons automatically. Check <strong>Apply automatic
          annotation</strong> and click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Depending on the length of your text, NER may take a while. Once completed, click
        <strong>Done</strong>. Congratulations! You have imported your first document
        into your workspace.
      </p>

      <h3>To upload a new image document</h3>
      <p>
        Repeat the steps above to create another document from your image file. In the last upload
        step, Recogito may take few seconds to convert your image into a <strong>zoomable
        image</strong>. But more on that later.
      </p>

      <h2 id="annotations">Step 2. Create Annotations</h2>
      <p>
        Open your text document by double-clicking it in the list. This will take you to the
        <strong>annotation view</strong>.
      </p>

      <h3>To create a text annotation</h3>
      <p>
        Select text like you would in any word processing tool: either by clicking and
        dragging with your mouse, or by double clicking a word. You can add text
        comments and tags, as well as identify the selected text as a
        <strong>Place</strong>, <strong>Person</strong> or <strong>Event</strong>. (We will learn
        more about how to deal with places in a minute.)
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="@routes.Assets.versioned("images/help/annotation-view.png")">
      </p>

      <p>
        Try experimenting with the annotation editor. You can change or delete each part of an
        annotation seperately, after you have created it. (To delete a tag, click on it first
        to get a delete button.) Deleting all parts of an annotation will also remove the highlight
        from the text.
      </p>

      <h3>To create an image annotation</h3>

      <p>
        <img src="@routes.Assets.versioned("images/help/image-controls.png")" class="inline right">
        Open your image document. Recogito has a <strong>zoomable view</strong> so you can
        navigate even highest-resolution images easily. Zoom using your mousewheel or
        the <span class="key">+</span> <span class="key">-</span> buttons in the upper right
        corner. On touch devices you can also use a &quot;pinch&quot; gesture. Pan by dragging and
        releasing the image.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can <strong>rotate</strong> the image at arbitrary angles. On a desktop computer,
        hold <span class="key">SHIFT</span> + <span class="key">Alt</span> while dragging with your
        mouse. On touch devices, use a pinch gesture. Use the button with the single arrow
        <span class="key icon">&#xf176;</span> to quickly rotate the image back to its
        original orientation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Let's create our first image annotation. In the toolbar, there is a drop-down menu where you
        can switch between Recogito's different selection modes: Point, Rectangle and Tilted Box.
        Select <strong>Point</strong> and create an annotation by clicking somewhere in your image.
        Switch back to <strong>Move</strong> to resume standard image navigation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now try annotating an area: pick the <strong>Rectangle</strong> tool. Click once to
        select the starting corner of the area. Then click again for the opposite corner.
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="@routes.Assets.versioned("images/help/tilted-box.gif")">
      </p>

      <p>
        The <strong>Tilted Box</strong> tool may take a bit more practice: select it from the menu.
        Click <strong>and hold</strong> the mouse button to draw the baseline of the box. Then release
        the mouse button. Move the mouse to define the height of the box, and click when you are
        happy with the height.
      </p>

      <p class="tip">
        Tip: the Tilted Box tool is especially useful for annotating labels in maps. Because
        there is an explicit <strong>baseline</strong>, the data you generate
        will also retain information about the <strong>orientation</strong> of the label.
      </p>

      <h2 id="map">Step 3. Identify and Map Places</h2>

      <p>
        You already know how to annotate a word or phrase in a document, and identify it as a
        reference to a place. Now let's assign this reference to a
        <a href="@controllers.help.routes.HelpController.showFAQ()#what-is-a-gazetteer">gazetteer</a>,
        so that Recogito can plot it on the map.
      </p>

      <p>
        Click <strong>Place</strong> in the annotation editor. Recogito will attempt to
        provide an automatic suggestion from
        <a href="@controllers.help.routes.HelpController.showFAQ()#available-gazetteers">its
        supported gazetteers</a>. You can either <strong>confirm</strong> this suggestion, or
        try to find a better match in the gazetteer search. If you can't find a suitable match,
        you also have the option to <strong>flag</strong> this reference, as an indication that
        no suitable match was available.
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="@routes.Assets.versioned("images/help/create-text-annotation.gif")">
      </p>

      <p>
        To speed up your work, Recogito will automatically search the text for identical phrases
        and give you the option to <strong>re-apply</strong> the gazetteer assignment to all
        other matches.
      </p>

      <h2 id="export">Step 4. Export Your Data</h2>

      <p>
        Select the <span class="outline-icon">&#xe875;</span> icon in the main navigation bar.
        This will take you to the available <strong>export options</strong> for your document. In
        addition to the options listed on this page, you can also download a <strong>backup
        package</strong> of your work from the <span class="outline-icon">&#xe8c9;</span> document
        settings page. We recommend to download backups for archiving and as an added security measure.
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="@routes.Assets.versioned("images/help/export.png")">
      </p>

      <h2 id="invite">Step 5. Invite Other Users</h2>

      <p>
        In this final step we are going to learn how you can share your documents with other
        users on Recogito, so that you can work as a team. Select the
        <span class="outline-icon">&#xe8c9;</span> icon in the main navigation bar. This will
        take you to the <strong>Document Settings</strong> page. In the left sidebar,
        select <strong>Sharing</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="@routes.Assets.versioned("images/help/share.gif")">
      </p>

      <p>
        Use the search field at the bottom of the <strong>Collaborators</strong> box to grant a user
        access to your document. You can choose between different levels of access:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Read</strong> allows users to view document and annotations, but not add
          annotations and comments themselves.</li>

        <li><strong>Write</strong> allows users to view and annotate the document.</li>

        <li><strong>Admin</strong> provides write access, and additionally allows users to
          edit document metadata, invite other collaborators, and perform administrative
          actions like downloading backups.</li>
      </ul>
