          Tell me, O muse, of that ingenious hero who travelled far and wide after he had
          sacked the famous town of <placeName>Troy</placeName>. Many cities did he visit,
          and many were the nations with whose manners and customs he was acquainted;
          moreover he suffered much by sea while trying to save his own life and bring his
          men safely home; but do what he might he could not save his men, for they perished
          through their own sheer folly in eating the cattle of the Sun-god
          <persName>Hyperion</persName>; so the god prevented them from ever
          reaching home. Tell me, too, about all these things, O daughter of Jove,
          from whatsoever source you may know them.
        </p>

        <p>
          So now all who escaped death in battle or by shipwreck had got safely home
          except <persName>Ulysses</persName>, and he, though he was longing to return to
          his wife and country, was detained by the goddess <persName>Calypso</persName>,
          who had got him into a large cave and wanted to marry him. But as years went by,
          there came a time when the gods settled that he should go back to
          <placeName ref="http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/530906">Ithaca</placeName>; even
          then, however, when he was among his own people, his troubles were not yet over;
          nevertheless all the gods had now begun to pity him except Neptune, who still
          persecuted him without ceasing and would not let him get home.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now Neptune had gone off to the Ethiopians, who are at the world's end, and lie in
          two halves, the one looking West and the other East. He had gone there to accept
          a hecatomb of sheep and oxen, and was enjoying himself at his festival; but the
          other gods met in the house of Olympian Jove, and the sire of gods and men spoke
          first. At that moment he was thinking of Aegisthus, who had been killed by
          Agamemnon's son Orestes; so he said to the other gods:
        </p>

        <p>
          &quot;See now, how men lay blame upon us gods for what is after all nothing but
          their own folly. Look at Aegisthus; he must needs make love to Agamemnon's wife
          unrighteously and then kill Agamemnon, though he knew it would be the death of him;
          for I sent Mercury to warn him not to do either of these things, inasmuch as
          Orestes would be sure to take his revenge when he grew up and wanted to return
          home. Mercury told him this in all good will but he would not listen, and now he
          has paid for everything in full.&quot;
        </p>

        <p>
          Then Minerva said, &quot;Father, son of Saturn, King of kings, it served Aegisthus
          right, and so it would any one else who does as he did; but Aegisthus is neither
          here nor there; it is for Ulysses that my heart bleeds, when I think of his
          sufferings in that lonely sea-girt island, far away, poor man, from all his
          friends. It is an island covered with forest, in the very middle of the sea,
          and a goddess lives there, daughter of the magician Atlas, who looks after the
          bottom of the ocean, and carries the great columns that keep heaven and earth
          asunder. This daughter of Atlas has got hold of poor unhappy Ulysses, and keeps
          trying by every kind of blandishment to make him forget his home, so that he
          is tired of life, and thinks of nothing but how he may once more see the smoke of
          his own chimneys. You, sir, take no heed of this, and yet when Ulysses was
          before <placeName ref="http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/550595">Troy</placeName> did
          he not propitiate you with many a burnt sacrifice? Why then should you keep on
          being so angry with him?&quot;
        </p>

        <p>
          And Jove said, &quot;My child, what are you talking about? How can I forget
          <persName>Ulysses</persName> than whom there is no more capable man on earth,
          nor more liberal in his offerings to the immortal gods that live in heaven? Bear in
          mind, however, that Neptune is still furious with Ulysses for having blinded an eye
          of Polyphemus king of the Cyclopes. Polyphemus is son to Neptune by the nymph
          Thoosa, daughter to the sea-king Phorcys; therefore though he will not kill
          Ulysses outright, he torments him by preventing him from getting home. Still, let
          us lay our heads together and see how we can help him to return; Neptune will then
          be pacified, for if we are all of a mind he can hardly stand out against us.&quot;
        </p>

        <p>
          And Minerva said, &quot;Father, son of Saturn, King of kings, if, then, the gods
          now mean that Ulysses should get home, we should first send Mercury to the
          <placeName ref="http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/456105">Ogygian island</placeName>
          to tell Calypso that we have made up our minds and that he is to return. In the
          meantime I will go to
          <placeName ref="http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/530906">Ithaca</placeName>, to put
          heart into Ulysses' son Telemachus; I will embolden him to call the Achaeans in
          assembly, and speak out to the suitors of his mother Penelope, who persist in
          eating up any number of his sheep and oxen; I will also conduct him to
          <placeName ref="http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/570685">Sparta</placeName> and
          to <placeName ref="http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/570640">Pylos</placeName>, to
          see if he can hear anything about the return of his dear father- for this will
          make people speak well of him.&quot;
